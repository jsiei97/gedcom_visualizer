# 📄 Compact PDF Layout Improvements

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: PDF reports were too spread out with each major section on separate pages, making them hard to read and wasting space.

**Solution**: Reorganized the document structure to be more compact and readable.

## Improvements Made

### 🏗️ **Document Structure Changes**

#### Before (Spread Out):
```
= Person Name
== Personal Information
  === Birth        [PAGE BREAK]
  === Death        [PAGE BREAK]
== Family Tree Diagram [PAGE BREAK]
== Parents           [PAGE BREAK]
== Spouse(s)         [PAGE BREAK]
== Children          [PAGE BREAK]
== Document Information [PAGE BREAK]
```

#### After (Compact):
```
= Person Name
== Personal Information
  *Birth Date:* ...
  *Birth Place:* ...
  *Death Date:* ...
  *Death Place:* ...

== Family Tree Diagram
  [Visual diagram]

== Family Information
  === Parents
    * Father: ...
    * Mother: ...
  === Spouse(s)
    * Spouse: ...
  === Children
    * Child 1: ...
    * Child 2: ...
  === Document Information
    Generated by...
```

### ⚙️ **New Command Options**

```bash
# Standard compact layout (default)
gedcom-generate file.ged @I123@ -o report.adoc

# Ultra-compact (no table of contents)
gedcom-generate file.ged @I123@ -o report.adoc --no-toc

# Text-only (no family tree diagram)
gedcom-generate file.ged @I123@ -o report.adoc --no-tree

# Minimal (no TOC, no tree)
gedcom-generate file.ged @I123@ -o report.adoc --no-toc --no-tree
```

### 📊 **Layout Benefits**

1. **All family info on one page**: Parents, spouse, and children are now grouped together
2. **Personal info consolidated**: Birth/death info integrated into main personal section
3. **Less page breaks**: Fewer level-2 headings (`==`) that cause page breaks
4. **Better flow**: Related information stays together
5. **Flexible options**: Users can choose level of compactness

### 🎯 **LaTeX Improvements**

- **Reduced margins**: 0.75 inch margins instead of default larger margins
- **Improved spacing**: Better control over section spacing
- **Better typography**: 11pt font size for readability

### 📈 **Results**

The new layout provides:
- **Same file size** but much better space utilization
- **All family relationships** visible at once
- **Professional appearance** with logical grouping
- **Faster reading** with less page flipping
- **Customizable compactness** based on user needs

## Usage Examples

### For Quick Family Overview:
```bash
gedcom-generate MyHeritage.ged @I500001@ -o quick_report.adoc --no-toc
